# VENOM Philosophy

## Design Principles

### 1. Biological Inspiration
Computation as a living organism with organs, circulation, and self-healing.

### 2. Fractal Architecture
Self-similar patterns at every scale, from 1ms pulses to system-wide rhythms.

### 3. Adaptive Intelligence
No fixed algorithms - continuous learning and adjustment based on environment.

### 4. Distributed Resilience
Multiple organs can fail without killing the organism. Mesh network provides redundancy.

### 5. Time as Resource
Time compression through mathematical transformations, not just parallelization.

## Core Concepts

**Theta (θ)**: System health metric reflecting hardware state
**Lambda (Λ)**: Hardware capability score
**Möbius Transform**: Non-linear time compression
**Organs**: Independent processing units with specific roles
**Mesh**: Distributed nervous system
**Pulse**: Synchronized heartbeat across all components

## Metaphors

- **Ω-AIOS**: Brain and nervous system
- **Λ-Genesis**: Internal organs
- **Bridge**: Circulatory system
- **Mesh**: Distributed neurons
- **Pulse**: Heartbeat
- **Guardian**: Immune system
- **RAG**: Memory recall
- **Tetrastrat**: Cortex hemispheres
